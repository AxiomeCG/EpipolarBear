# EpipolarBear
Reflexions, proof of concepts, materials about epipolar geometry.

# Goal

The main goal of the repository is to build knowledge about the basic concepts of epipolar geometry. 
This is linked to student research about creating a 3D map of a room based on multiples pictures taken with one or multiple camera.

# Form of the repository

For the moment, the structure of the repository is undefined. At the beginning, it will be used to share one or multiple Jupyter Notebook with opencv, to find and demonstrate what can be achieved with epipolar geometry.
